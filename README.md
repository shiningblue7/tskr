# Tskr

Tskr is a open source, task and asset tracking application built on [RedwoodJS].
Imagine a low-cost task and asset tracking system where you define complex rules
to execute the business needs you have â€” that's Tskr. We are an opinionated
system. We make the decisions so you don't have to.



## Features

- Simple Role Based Access.(Not Implemented Yet)
  What does that mean?
  There's a lot of places you have to secure to ensure a safe system.
  We've abstracted that down to one file.
  If you want to change what roles have access to parts of Tskr, you
  only need to edit [./api/src/lib/roles.js]
- Rules.(Not Implemented Yet)
  What are rules?
  Rules are bits of code that can execute to make outbound calls,
  update records, or modify what was submitted. Here are the default
  ones on task.
  - [Calculate Priority]
  - [Email Assigned to]
  - [Assign High Priorities to Hugh]
  - [Log when something is deleted]
  - [Update title to append \[Solved\]]
- Responsive Email templating via MJML(Not Implemented Yet)
- Mailgun integrated as the email service provider.(Not Implemented Yet)
- Created with the [JAMStack] in mind.
  This is a great way to spin up something that has low risk, low cost,
  and a lot of potiental upsides.
